## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick Nowakowski! I am currently a Master's Degree student in the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC Lab) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison ðŸ¦¡.

I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering in 2024, with a focus on digital system design. Now, my research is in control of power electronics for power conversion devices.

In my time at WEMPEC as both an undergraduate and graduate student, I have been contributed heavily to the open-source [Advanced Motor Drive Controller](https://www.amdc.dev) (AMDC) platform, doing both PCB design and embedded systems programming.

My username is derived from my enjoyment of programming, Rubik's speedcubing, and pi (as well as pie).
